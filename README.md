Bricks Jol: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Bricks Jol app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Jorge Ortega-Lopez. The app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.

If you have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to help you.

Yours sincerely,

Jorge Ortega-Lopez
